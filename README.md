# wic_breastfeeding_project
In my statistical consulting senior project class, we used data from WIC to answer two main research questions. This was a group project, however I was heavily involved in the consulting and analytical aspect of this project. This was done in SAS. I also have included our Memo, Memo Slides, and my individual Consulting Debrief slides.
